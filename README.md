# After The Fallout

Through this game you'll uncover how the doomsday clock finally met midnight  across the world while playing as a young radiation deformed orphan trying to find a new home.

## Notice:
**The first release of this game will be a early prototype with not much gameplay. If you follow the development of the game give me feedback on what you want to be added, I'll do it (as long as it isn't stupid).  If you want to speed up production if you donate [here](https://buymeacoffee.com/luka22r) I can use that to fund pixel artists to make artwork for me.**

In the meantime this itch.io submission will act as a place to hype up the game along with the YouTube channel [here](https://youtube.com/@luka22r?si=iSY70a3Q7opFxS7i).
